# Miniclock

This lightweight JS script puts a well-formatted, human-friendly timer on your webpage.

## Usage

Attach `miniclock.js` to an HTML document as a **defered** script:

```
<script defer src="/path/to/miniclock.js"></script>
```

Don't forget the `defer` attribute, otherwise Miniclock may fail.

After the inclusion demonstrated above, no additional actions is required: the current date and time will be displayed
and continuously updated every second inside any HTML element that has `.miniclock` CSS class.
